```
export ESUN="path_to_EarthSunDistance.txt_file"
```

### Data Processing Requirements
This version of the CFMASK application requires the input products to be in the ESPA internal file format.

The following input data are required to generate the cloud masking products:
* Top of Atmosphere Reflectance
* Brightness Temperature

These products can be generated using the [LEDAPS](https://github.com/USGS-EROS/espa-surface-reflectance) software found in our [espa-surface-reflectance](https://github.com/USGS-EROS/espa-surface-reflectance) project.  Or through our ondemand processing system [ESPA](https://espa.cr.usgs.gov), be sure to select the ENVI output format.

This cloud masking product is currently available in the [ESPA](https://espa.cr.usgs.gov) processing system as part of the Surface Reflectance product.
